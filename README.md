# GLP-1_Study
This claims study observes individuals that have taken weight-loss GLP-1s (Wegovy, Saxenda, or Zepbound) for three years since 2022-2024 and analyzes their mean differences in cost.

Members in the GLP-1 cohort are defined as those that have been continuously enrolled in their medical plan since January 2021. They will have at least 3 years of scripts for the drugs Wegovy, Saxenda, or Zepbound. Paid medical and pharmacy claims are reviewed from 2021 - 2024, with 2021 serving as the baseline year. In a book of business that holds over one million lives, there were 461 individuals that met this criteria for study. Numbers were adjusted for inflation to trend up to 2024.

In comparison, a matched pairs cohort was created to compare mean costs against those who have a medical claim diagnosis for overwieght or obesity, but were not prescribed any weight-loss GLP-1 drugs. Diabetic GLP-1s were removed from consideration. Matched pairs were determined by age, member relationship, and gender (with at least an overweight diagnosis).

The hypothesis was that members who are taking the GLP-1 drugs would offset the sky-rocketing pharmaceutical costs with lower medical costs. When adjusted for inflation, the average medical claims difference per member from 2021 - 2024 was a savings of $1,554. However, employers lost about $11,834 average per member on pharmaceuticals over the same four years. This was a net loss of $10,280 average per member for those that took these drugs. While there were medical savings, they were not statistically significant. They also had no chance of offsetting the pharmacy costs.

The matched pairs cohort was run to see if those who had similar conditions but were not taking GLP-1s had less of a financial impact on the plan. After running the statisical anlysis, it was determined that the net loss of medical and pharmacy claims were about $9,892 over the four years. After running a matched pairs mean difference t-test, it was determined the null hypothesis could not be rejected and that the mean differences of the controlled and treatment (GLP-1) group were not statistically different. 

This study demonstrated that regardless of whether overweight people take GLP-1s or not, they still have a similar impact on the plan. For employee retention and well-being, it may still be a worthy strategy to cover GLP-1s as an individual's sense of confidence, well-being, and health cannot be surveyed through health plan costs.

Tools used to perform this analysis were SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebooks and Power BI.
